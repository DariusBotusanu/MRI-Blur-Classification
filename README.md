# MRI-Blur-Classification
The aim of this project is to **classify MRI images** into two categories: those which present motion artifacts called “**motion**” and those where the patients stood still during scanning, “**nomotion**”.
An exhaustive description of what has been tried is present in the "Description and Report" document. 
The project is not yet finished and the current goals are to:
- Find a way to separate the motion artifacts
- Find an architecture that performs reasonably well when evaluated with **cross-validation**
